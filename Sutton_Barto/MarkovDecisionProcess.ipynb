    "## Finite Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "MDPs are a classical formalization of sequential decision making, where actions influence not just immediate rewards, but also subsequent situations, or states, and through those future rewards. It involves evaluative feedback similar to armed bandits but also an associative aspect which involves different actions in different situations.\n",

    "In a finite MDP, the sets of states, actions, and rewards (S,A, and R) all have a finite number of elements. In this case, the random variables Rt and St have well defined discrete probability distributions dependent only on the preceding state and action.\n",

    "**Policies and Value functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all reinforcement learning algorithms involve estimating value functions -- functions of states (or of state-action pairs) that estimate how good it is for the agent to be in a given state (or how good it is to perform a given action in a given state). The notion of  “how good\" here is defined in terms of future rewards that can be expected, or, to be precise, in terms of expected return. Of course the rewards the agent can expect to receive in the future depend on what actions it will take. Accordingly, value functions are defined with respect to particular ways of acting, called policies.\n",
